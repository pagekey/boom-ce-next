# Contributing to Boom

## Getting Started

Please join the [PageKey GitLab](https://discord.com/invite/5m5yFgDPF5) and introduce yourself! We'll be happy to help you get started contributing to the codebase and answer any questions.

## Feature Proposals

Feel free to discuss any feature ideas informally in Discord. If you want to get serious about implementing it, create a branch and add a folder for your feature in `doc/architecture`. You can copy `_template.md` into that folder and rename it to `index.md`. When you think you're ready, create a merge request for your branch and tag the appropriate people for review.
