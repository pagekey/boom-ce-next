# User Accounts

## Summary

Boom needs a way for people to create and login to accounts. This allows data generated by each person to be associated with them and not mixed in with everyone else's data. The user creates an account using an email and password. They receive a confirmation email and confirm their account, then are able to login with the email and password provided. Upon first sign-in, information such as Display Name, Native Language, and Target Langauge are collected.

## Motivation

If we have no user accounts, there's no way to track data for each user.

With user accounts, there is potential for social interaction between users on the site.

### Goals

- Users can create accounts
- Users must activate account via email before using it
- Users can reset password

### Non-Goals

Out of scope:
- For now, social login is out of scope (too complex / too much setup)

## Proposal

- Add a registration page asking for email, password, and password confirmation.
- When handling form submission, create user in DB and send email with activation code link.
- On the activation route, check the token for validity.
  - If valid, set account active and redirect. 
  - Otherwise, display failure message.
- User can login using email and password, receiving an auth token.
- User can logout by deleting the auth token.

## Design and implementation details

### User Story

Actor | Action | Design/Link
------|------- | ------
User | goes to home page and clicks Sign Up | [Home Page](#home-page)
User | fills out Register Page | [Register Page](#register-page)
Server | carries out the Register Route and sends an email | [Register Route](#register-route)
User | checks their email and clicks a link | [Email Template](#email-template)
Server | checks code and activates user | [Activate Route](#activate-route)

TODO - put the list below into the table above

- User:     fills out the Getting Started Page with their name and first LanguagePair.
- User:     clicks log out.
- Server:   unsets session cookie if present
- Frontend: deletes session data if present
- User:     tries to login.
- User:     clicks the Forgot Password link.
- User:     enters their email.
- Server:   checks whether the email is valid and sends a password reset email.
- User:     checks their email and clicks the reset link.
- Frontend shows 

### Pages

#### Home Page

(only specify what is relevant for user accounts - namely presence of Sign Up, Login buttons)

#### Register Page

This page lets the user register. The fewest fields possible are included to get the user signed up as quickly as possible. Additional fields will be filled in after the user activates their account.

It contains the following fields:

- Email
- Password
- Password Confirmation

#### Email Template

TODO

### Routes

#### Register Route


TODO - make sure everything below this line has been accounted for in the [User Story](#user-story)

----

### Login Flow

### Forgot Password Flow


#### Login Page

#### Forgot Password Page

#### Getting Started Page

On the page, the user sets up their display name and first LanguagePair. These are saved to their profile upon creation.

Upon submission, this page will submit to the Onboard User route.

### Routes


**AKA: Create User Route**

TODO

#### Activate Route

#### Login Route

#### Logout Route

#### Reset Password Request Route

#### Change Password Route

#### Onboard User

### DB Design

Only the basic tables required for user accounts and language selection will be included in this design doc.

#### User

User is implemented using a Prisma schema.

Field | Type | Description
------|------|------------
id | Int | Auto-incremented unique id
created | DateTime | Time of registration
email | String | Unique email
passwordHash | String | Hashed password
passwordSalt | String | Salt for password
interfaceLanguage | Language | Language that the user prefers to display the application in

#### LanguagePair

Field | Type | Description
------|-----|------------
id | Int | Auto-incremented unique id
user | User | User who is learning this LanguagePair
source | Language | Language you already know
target | Language | Language you are learning

#### Language

Field | Type | Description
-------|------|------------
id | Int | Auto-incremented unique id
name | String | Language name (English)
code | String | Three letter ISO code for the language

## Alternative Solutions

Make Boom a local-only application. It's offline all the time, or a desktop app, and there is no way for users to interact. Kinda lame.
