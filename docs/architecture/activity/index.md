# Activity Logging

## Summary

Activity Logging is perhaps the most important feature in Boom. It enables the user to keep track of their progress. Being able to look back on all the hard work they did, they will feel a sense of accomplishment and be excited to get back to it.

The Activity Logging feature provides an easy way for any other Boom feature to track user actions. It also provides an easy way to review activity on each user's profile.

Privacy settings on each log allows users to keep their actions private if they would prefer.

## Motivation

Learning a language is a long, complex, trying process. You can't learn a language in a day.

The ability to track what you've done so far makes it easier to see the progress you've made and stay motivated.

It also lends itself to social aspects of the app - people can check out how their friends are learning and possibly find new techniques, or even learn new vocabulary if they happen to be learning the same language.

### Goals

- Routes for saving activities exist.
  - They are general enough that any future Boom feature will be able to use them.
- Routes for querying activies are implemented.
- Components for displaying activites are implemented.
- Activity privacy settings are implemented.
- User profile exists and shows latest activities for the user.

### Non-Goals

Out of scope:

- User creation. For this, see `user/index.md`.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is,
but keep it simple!  This should have enough detail that reviewers can
understand exactly what you're proposing, but should not include things like
API designs or implementation. The "Design Details" section below is for the
real nitty-gritty.

You might want to consider including the pros and cons of the proposed solution so that they can be
compared with the pros and cons of alternatives.
-->

## Design and implementation details

(note: title, description, tags, category, custom fields?)
<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.

If you are not sure how many implementation details you should include in the
blueprint, the rule of thumb here is to provide enough context for people to
understand the proposal. As you move forward with the implementation, you may
need to add more implementation details to the blueprint, as those may become
an important context for important technical decisions made along the way. A
blueprint is also a register of such technical decisions. If a technical
decision requires additional context before it can be made, you probably should
document this context in a blueprint. If it is a small technical decision that
can be made in a merge request by an author and a maintainer, you probably do
not need to document it here. The impact a technical decision will have is
another helpful information - if a technical decision is very impactful,
documenting it, along with associated implementation details, is advisable.

If it's helpful to include workflow diagrams or any other related images.
Diagrams authored in GitLab flavored markdown are preferred. In cases where
that is not feasible, images should be placed under `images/` in the same
directory as the `index.md` for the proposal.

## Alternative Solutions

<!--
It might be a good idea to include a list of alternative solutions or paths considered, although it is not required. Include pros and cons for
each alternative solution/path.

"Do nothing" and its pros and cons could be included in the list too.
